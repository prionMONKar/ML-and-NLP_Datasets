FADE FROM BLACK: Int. of Don Corleone's home office -day 

BONASERA (seated in front of the Don's desk, facing the camera)

I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the

American fashion. I gave her freedom, but -- I taught her never to dishonor her family. She

found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I

didn't protest. Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made

her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her

honor. So they beat her, like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was a'broken.

Her jaw was a'shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life -- beautiful girl. Now she will

never be beautiful again.

[Bonasera breaks down. The Don gestures to Sonny to give Bonasera a drink]

Sorry...

[Bonasera, taking the drink, sips from the shot glass]

I -- I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The

judge sentenced them to three years in prison -- suspended sentence. Suspended sentence!

They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastard,

they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, "for justice, we must go to Don Corleone." 

VITO CORLEONE (sitting behind his desk, petting a cat)

Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? 

BONASERA

What do you want of me? Tell me anything. But do what I beg you to do. 

VITO CORLEONE

What is that? 

[Bonasera gets up to whisper his request into Don Corleone's ear] 

That I cannot do. 

BONASERA

I'll give you anything you ask. 

VITO CORLEONE

We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you came to me for counsel,

for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of

coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here: you

never wanted my friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. 

BONASERA

I didn't want to get into trouble. 

VITO CORLEONE

I understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The

police protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. But

uh, now you come to me and you say -- "Don Corleone give me justice." -- But you don't ask

with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead,

you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you uh ask me to do

murder, for money. 

BONASERA

I ask you for justice. 

VITO CORLEONE

That is not justice; your daughter is still alive. 

BONASERA

Then they can suffer then, as she suffers.

(then)

How much shall I pay you? 

VITO CORLEONE (stands, turning his back toward Bonasera)

Bonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had

you come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering

this very day. And that by chance if an honest man such as yourself should make enemies,

then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you. 

BONASERA

Be my friend --

(then, after bowing and the Don shrugs)

-- Godfather? 

VITO CORLEONE (after Bonasera kisses his hand)

Good.

(then)

Some day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But uh,

until that day -- accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day. 

BONASERA (as he leaves the room)

Grazie, Godfather. 

VITO CORLEONE

Prego.

(then, to Tom Hagen, after Bonasera leaves the room)

Ah, give this to ah, Clemenza. I want reliable people; people that aren't gonna be carried

away. I'm mean, we're not murderers, despite of what this undertaker says.

Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing [jazz music begins to play from party]

NAZORINE (seated in front of the Don't desk)

But towards the end, he was uh paroled to help with the American uh war effort. So for the last six months he's been working in my pastry shop. 

VITO CORLEONE (seated)

Nazorine, my friend, what can I do for you? 

NAZORINE

Well now that the war is over, this boy, Enzo -- they want to repatriate him back to Italy.

Godfather, I have a daughter. You see, she and Enzo... 

VITO CORLEONE

You want Enzo to stay in this country, and you want your daughter to be married. 

NAZORINE (stands)

You understand everything. 

[they shake hands, Nazorine turns to leave] 

VITO CORLEONE

Bene. 

NAZORINE (now by the door with Tom Hagen)

Mr. Hagen, thank you.

(then, turning to Don Corleone)

An' wait til you see the beautiful wedding cake I made for your daughter! Ooof! [gestures]

Like this! The bride and the groom and the angel... 

TOM (after Nazorine exits)

Who should I give this job to? 

VITO CORLEONE

Not to our paisan. Give it to a Jew congressman, in another district. Who else is on the list? 

CUT TO: Michael and Kay arrive, make some introductions. Kay says hello to one of the

guests, and someone says Michael's name. They dance to "Ev'rytime I Look In Your Eyes"

as the Don watches from his window -day 

CUT TO: The Don's office -day 

TOM

He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you 

VITO CORLEONE

Is this -- Is this necessary? 

TOM

He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, so he wanted to thank you. 

VITO CORLEONE

All right. 

CUT TO: Outside of the Corleone residence, Luca sits, rehearsing his lines -day 

LUCA BRASI (rehearsing his lines aloud)

Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the

wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child.

(then, starting over, which continues throughout the following dialogue)

Don -- Don Corleone... 

KAY

Michael, that man over there is talking to himself. See that scary guy over there? 

LUCA'S VOICE

...on the wedding day of your daughter... 

MICHAEL (after glancing over at Luca)

He's a very scary guy. 

KAY

Well, who is he? What's his name? 

MICHAEL

His name is Luca Brasi -- an' he helps my father out sometimes. 

[Luca stands up, facing Mike and Kay, seemingly coming toward them] 

KAY

Oh, Michael, wait a minute; he's coming over here... 

TOM (appearing in view)

Mike! 

MICHAEL

Oh! 

TOM (embracing Michael)

Heh...! You look terrific! 

MICHAEL

My brother, Tom Hagen -- this is Kay Adams. 

TOM

How do you do. 

KAY

How do you do, Tom 

TOM (into Michael's ear)

Your father's been asking for you

(then, to Kay, before he leaves)

Very nice to meet you 

KAY

Nice to meet you

(then, after Tom exits to bring Luca into the Don's office)

If he's your brother, why does he have a different name? 

MICHAEL

Oh, ah, that -- when my brother Sonny was a kid, he found Tom Hagen in the street. And he

had no home -- and so my father took him in -- and he's been with us ever since. He's a good

lawyer. Not a Sicilian, but -- I think he's gonna be consiglieri. 

KAY

What's that? 

MICHAEL

That's um, like a counselor -- an advisor -- very important to the family.

(then)

You like your lasagna? 

CUT TO: Luca Brasi in Don Corleone's office -day 

LUCA BRASI (after kissing the Don's left cheek)

Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your daugh-- ter's wedding...

(then, after realizing he messed up his rehearsed lines, he fails to recover)

...on the day of your daughter's wedding. And I hope that their first child be a masculine child. I pledge my ever-ending loyalty. -- 

[Playing kids run into the room and then are escorted out by Tom] 

(then, as Luca hands Don Corleone a cash-filled envelope)

For your daughter's bridal purse. 

VITO CORLEONE

Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend. 

LUCA BRASI

Don Corleone, I'm gonna leave you now, because I know you are busy. 

VITO CORLEONE

Thank you. 

[Tom escorts Luca out] 

CUT TO: Bride & groom dance to "The Godfather Fox Trot"

CUT TO: Sonny moves closer to Lucy to whisper into her ear

CUT TO: Sandra gestures to other women about the size of Sonny's manhood; they laugh;

Sandra turns to see Lucy get up to meet Sonny

CUT TO: Singing and dancing on stage 

VOICE (urging Mama Corleone to come onto the stage to sing)

Signora Corleone! -- [more] 

MAMA (laughingly)

No -- no -- no! [more]

(then, once on stage)

La stessa storia? ["the same story?"] La stessa storia!

(then sings the first verse to "Luna Mezz'a Mare")

(then, Mama calls Nazorine to the stage) 

CUT TO: Sonny goes upstairs

CUT TO: An old man continues "Luna Mezz'a Mare" while Nazorine dances and laughs on stage

CUT TO: Lucy Mancini goes upstairs

CUT TO: The old man who was singing is now dancing

CUT TO: Don's office.

Senator Cauly apologized for not coming personally -- he said you'd understand. Also, some of the judges. They've all sent gifts.

(then, toasting to the Don)

Salute! 

[OS: Screaming of joy from the party outside] 

VITO CORLEONE

What is that outside? 

CUT TO: Outside, Johnny Fontane enters the party, signing autographs 

CONNIE (while running up to Johnny, then hugging him)

Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! I love you! 

CUT TO: Don's office. The Don is looking out the window 

VITO

He came all the way from California to come to the wedding; I told you he was going to

come. 

TOM

It's been two years; he's probably in trouble again. 

VITO

He's a good godson. 

CUT TO: Bandstand area -day 

MAMA CORLEONE

Johnny, Johnny! [In Italian: "Sing a song"]

(then, in English)

Sing a song. 

[the crowd encourages Johnny, and he gives in] 

CUT TO: Michael and Kay's table -day 

KAY

Mike, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! 

MICHAEL

Sure... You wanna meet him? 

KAY

Huh? Oh, well, sure! 

MICHAEL

My father helped him with his career. 

JOHNNY (OS)

For my Connie... 

KAY

He did? How? 

JOHNNY (OS, singing "I Have But One Heart")

"I have but one heart..." 

MICHAEL

Let's listen to the song... 

KAY

Oh, Michael... 

CUT TO: Johnny singing to Connie, who's seated. Then PAN the crowd cheering and

screaming as Johnny sings 

JOHNNY (singing, continues)

"...this heart I bring you / I have but one heart / To share with you / I have but one dream /

That I can cling to / You are the one dream/I pray comes true..." 



KAY

Please, Michael, tell me. 

JOHNNY (OS, continues the song)

"My darling, until I saw you..." 

MICHAEL

Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to this personal service contract;

with a big band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it.

Now, Johnny is my father's godson. And my father went to see this band leader, and he

offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go. But the band leader said no. So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1,000. 


KAY

How'd he do that? 


MICHAEL

My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. 


KAY

What was that? 


MICHAEL

Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains -- or his signature -- would be on the contract.

(then)

That's a true story.

(then, after we see Johnny ending the song)

That's my family, Kay. It's not me. 

CUT TO: Bandstand area -day 

MAMA (OS)

Bene! Bene! 

[The song is finished, and we hear applause. The Don goes out to meet and hug

Johnny, and they, and other guests, toast. The Mazurka music and dancing continue] 

VITO (to the surrounding guests)

My godson comes all the way from California...give him a glass of wine 

VOICE (OS)

Salute! 

JOHNNY (whispers into the Don's ear that he wants to talk to him) 

VITO CORLEONE

I'll take care of it.

(then, to Tom)

Tom, I want you to find Santino. Tell him to come to the office. 

[Tom looks up, as if knowing what Sonny's up to] 

CUT TO: Michael and Kay's table at the reception 

MICHAEL (with Kay, gets tapped in the head by Fredo)

Oh!

(then, noticing Fredo)

How are you, Fredo?

(then)

Fredo -- my brother Fredo -- this is Kay Adams 

KAY

Oh, hi

FREDO (apparently drunk)

How'ya doing?

(then, after Fredo kisses Kay on the cheek)

This is my brother, Mike. 

MICHAEL

Are you having a good time? 

FREDO

Huh? yeah...

(then)

This your friend, huh? 

CUT TO: Johnny Fontane in the Don's office. -day 

JOHNNY

I don't know what to do. My voice is -- is weak. It's weak. Anyway, uh, if I had this part in

the picture, ya'know, it puts me right back up on top again. But this, uh -- this man out there,

he won't give it to me; the head of the studio. 

VITO CORLEONE

What's his name? 

JOHNNY

Woltz -- Woltz. He -- He won't give it to me -- and ah, he says there's no chance. No chance. 

CUT TO: Tom looking for Sonny inside the house 

TOM (at the bottom of the stairs)

Sonny? Sonny? 


[Sonny and Lucy are going at it, standing against a door in an upstairs bedroom. Tom goes upstairs, then knocks on the bedroom door] 

TOM

Sonny? Sonny you in there? 

SONNY (stopping the action)

What? 

TOM

Your old man wants to see you. 

SONNY

Yeah, one minute. 

[Tom smiles, and walks away, as Sonny and Lucy continue] 

LUCY

Oh, Sonny! 

CUT TO: A woman singing Italian song, opera-like, on the stage -day

CUT TO: The Don's office 

JOHNNY (as Tom quietly enters the Don's office)

A month ago he bought the movie rights to this book. A bestseller -- and the main character,

it's a guy just like me. I uh -- I wouldn't even have to act -- just be myself. Oh, Godfather, I

don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. 

VITO CORLEONE

You can act like a man!

(then, after slapping Johnny on the face)

What's the matter with you? Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood

finocchio that ah cries like a woman?

(then imitating Johnny, as Tom giggles)

What can I do?! What can I do?!

(then)

What is that nonsense? Ridiculous. 

[Sonny enters the room] 

VITO CORLEONE (to Johnny, after glancing to see Sonny enter)

You spend time with your family? 


JOHNNY

Sure I do. 


VITO CORLEONE (to Johnny, but toward and about Sonny)

Good. 'Cause a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.

(then, to Johnny)

Come're.

(then)

You look terrible. I want you to eat. I want you to rest a while. And in a month from now,

this -- Hollywood bigshot's gonna give you what you want. 

JOHNNY

It's too late, they start shooting in a week 

VITO CORLEONE

I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.

(then)

Now you just go outside and enjoy yourself, and ah, forget about all this nonsense. I want

you to leave it all to me. 

JOHNNY (exiting)

All right 

VITO CORLEONE (after Johnny exits)

Well... 

CUT TO: The cake comes out. Nazorine, the baker, takes a proud bow. The Tarantella plays

again. 

CUT TO: The Don's office 

VITO CORLEONE

What time does my daughter leave with the bridegroom? 

TOM

In a few minutes, right after they cut the cake.

(then, as we hear clinking glasses coming from outside, which continues)

Now your new son-in-law; give him something important? 

VITO CORLEONE

Never. Give him a living, but never discuss the Family business with him. What else? 

TOM

Virgil Sollozzo called. Now we're gonna have to give him a day sometime next week. 

VITO CORLEONE

We'll discuss it when you come back from California. 

TOM (laughing)

When am I going to California? 

VITO CORLEONE

I want you to go tonight; I want you to talk to this -- movie bigshot, and settle this business

for Johnny. Now, if there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding. 

***Extra footage from The TRILOGY & SAGA*** 

TOM

Uh -- the hospital called. Um --Consiglieri Genco -- he's not gonna last out the night. 

VITO CORLEONE

Santino, go tell your brothers that I went them to come with me to visit Genco to pay their

respects. Tell Fredo to drive the big car... outside now. 

SONNY

Uh, Pop... Michael? 

VITO CORLEONE

JANIE'S MOTHER (after Janie kisses Woltz)

Ah, isn't that nice... 

WOLTZ (who's just walked toward Tom)

All right, start talking. 

TOM

Uh, I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane's -- His friend is my client, who'd give his

undying friendship to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz would grant us a small -- favor. 

WOLTZ

Woltz is listening. 

TOM

Give Johnny the part in that new war film you're starting next week. 

WOLTZ (laughs, then)

And ah, what favor would ah your friend ah grant Mr. Woltz? 

TOM

You're gonna have some union problems; my client could make then disappear. Also, one of

your top stars has just moved from ah marijuana to heroin... 

WOLTZ

Are you trying to muscle me? 

TOM

Absolutely not. 

WOLTZ

Now listen to me, you smooth-talking son-of-a-bitch! Let me lay it on the line for you and

your boss, whoever he is. Johnny Fontane will never get that movie! I don't care how many -

- daigo guinea WOP greaseball gumbahs come out of the woodwork! 

TOM

I'm German-Irish... 

WOLTZ

Well let me tell you something my Kraut Mick friend, I'm gonna make so much trouble for

you, you won't know what hit you! 

TOM

Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer, I have not threatened you. 

WOLTZ

I know almost every big lawyer in New York, who the hell are you? 

TOM

I have a special practice; I handle one client -- Now you have my number; I'll wait for your

call -- By the way, I admire your pictures very much. 

[Tom shakes Woltz' hand, then leaves] 

WOLTZ (to a staff member)

Check him out... 

CUT TO: Later, Tom and Woltz walking around Woltz' estate. "Manhattan Serenade" plays

again. -early evening 

TOM

This is really beautiful. 

WOLTZ

Well, look at this. It used to decorate the palace of a king. 

TOM

Oh, yeah; very nice. 

WOLTZ

Why didn't you say you worked for Corleone, Tom? I thought you were just some cheap

two-bit hustler Johnny was running in trying to bluff me. 

TOM

I don't like to use his name unless it's really necessary. 

WOLTZ

How's your drink, Tom? 

TOM

Fine 

WOLTZ

Hey, come on over here with me; I wanna show you something really beautiful. You do

appreciate beauty, don't you?

(then)

There you are, $600,000 on four hooves. I bet a Russian Czar never paid that kind of dough

for a single horse.

(then, toward the horse)

Khartoum. Khartoum.

(then, to Tom)

I'm not gonna race him, though. I'm gonna put him out to stud. 

TOM

He's beautiful. 

WOLTZ (to stablehand)

Thanks, Tony. 

TONY

You're welcome... 

WOLTZ (to Tom)

Let's get something to eat, huh? 

CUT TO: Woltz' dinner table -early evening 

TOM

Mr. Corleone is Johnny's godfather. To the Italian people, that's a very religious, sacred,

close relationship. 

WOLTZ

I respect that; just tell him he should ask me anything else. But this is one favor I can't give

him. 

TOM

He doesn't ask a second favor once he's been refused the first, understood? 

[Gaffe: Waiter fills Tom's wine glass twice, shown in two camera angles] 

WOLTZ

You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. That part is perfect for him;

it'll make him a big star. And I'm gonna run him out of the business, and let me tell you why.

(then, after he stands)

Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges. For five years

we had her under training. Singing lessons; acting lessons, dancing lessons. I spent hundreds

of thousands of dollars on her. I was gonna make her a big star! And let me be even more

frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, and it's not all dollars and cents.

She was beautiful; she was young, she was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I ever

had, and I had'em all over the world! And then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive-

oil voice, and guinea charm. And she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me look

ridiculous! And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous! Now you

get the hell outta here! And if that gumbah tries any rough stuff, you tell him I ain't no band

leader! Yeah, I heard that story.... 

TOM

Thank you for the dinner and a very pleasant evening. If your car could take me to the

airport; Mr. Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news immediately. 

[Tom nods, then exits] 

***Extra footage from The TRILOGY & SAGA*** 





*** 

CUT TO: pan of exterior of Woltz' estate, music is a variation of the Title Theme, then we

see the interior of Woltz' bedroom. Woltz awakens in a pool of blood, and finds Khartoum's

severed head in his bed; and SCREAMS ah - ah - ah - ah - ah! -dawn 

DISSOLVE TO: close-up of Vito Corleone's face; he nods -evening 

VITO CORLEONE

You're not too tired, are you, Tom? 

TOM

No, no. I slept on the plane.

(then, as we see Sollozzo entering the Don's office from the street)

I have the Sollozzo notes here. Now -- Sollozzo is known as 'The Turk.' He's supposed to be

very good with a knife, but only in matters of business or some sort of reasonable complaint.

Uh, his business is narcotics. He has fields in Turkey where they grow the poppy. And in

Sicily he has the plants to process them into heroin. Now -- he needs cash, and he needs

protection from the police, for which he gives a piece of the action -- I couldn't find out how

much. The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York. Now they have to be in it for

something. 

CUT TO: Sonny introducing himself to Sollozzo, shaking hands -day 

SONNY

Sonny Corleone... 

CUT TO: Back to Don, Sonny and Tom before the meeting -evening 

VITO CORLEONE

What about his prison record? 

TOM

Two terms. One in Italy, one here. He's known as a top narcotics man. 

VITO CORLEONE

Santino? Whattaya think? 

SONNY

There's a lot of money in that white powder. 

VITO CORLEONE

Tom? 

TOM [Sollozzo scenes still intercut]

Well, I say yes. There's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking

at. Now if we don't get into it, somebody else will. Maybe one of the Five Families, maybe

all of them. Now with the money they earn, they can buy more police and political power;

then they come after us. Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; an' they're the best

things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. An' if we don't get a piece of that

action, we risk everything we have -- I mean not now, but ah ten years from now. 

SONNY

So, what's your answer gonna be, Pop? 

CUT TO: Sollozzo meeting in Don Corleone's Genco office. Scene includes the Don,

Sollozzo, Tom, Sonny, Fredo, Clemenza, and Tessio sitting in Room #2 -day 

SOLLOZZO

Bene. Don Corleone. I need a man who has powerful friends. I need a million dollars in

cash. I need, Don Corleone, those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like so many

nickels and dimes. 

VITO CORLEONE

What is the interests for my family? 

SOLLOZZO

Thirty percent. In the first year, your end should be three- four-million dollars. And then it

would go up. 

VITO CORLEONE

And what is the interest for the Tattaglia Family? 

SOLLOZZO (to Tom)

My compliments.

(then to Don Corleone)

I'll take care of the Tattaglia's, outta my share. 

VITO CORLEONE

So I receive thirty percent for finance -- political influence, and legal protection, that's what

your telling me? 

SOLLOZZO

That's right 

VITO CORLEONE

Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve this generosity? 

SOLLOZZO

If you consider a million dollars in cash just finance, te salute, Don Corleone. 

VITO CORLEONE (gets up to pour Sollozzo another drink)

I said that I would see you because, I heard that you're a serious man, to be treated with

respect.

(then, after sitting)

But uh, I must say "no" to you -- and I'll give you my reasons. It's true, I have a lot of friends

in politics, but they wouldn't be friendly very long if they knew my business was drugs

instead of gambling, which they rule that as a -- harmless vice. But drugs is a dirty business. 

SOLLOZZO

Don Corleone... 

VITO CORLEONE

It -- makes -- it doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living, understand.

But your business is ah -- a little dangerous. 

SOLLOZZO

If you're worried about security for your million, the Tattaglia's will guarantee it. 

SONNY

Aw, you're telling me that the Tattaglia's guarantee our investment? 

VITO CORLEONE (to Sonny)

Wait a minute... 

[Clemenza and Tom look at each other, realizing Sonny's faux pas. Sollozzo

notices] 

VITO CORLEONE (to Sollozzo)

I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them as you can see; they talk

when they should listen. But, anyway, Signor Sollozzo, my no is final, and I wish to

congratulate you on your new business, and I know you'll do very well; and good luck to you

-- as best as your interests don't conflict with my interests. Thank you. 

[the group begins to leave the room: Sollozzo, Clemenza, Tessio, then Fredo] 

VITO CORLEONE

Santino, come're. Whattsa matter with you? I think your brain is going soft from all that

comedy your playing with that young girl. Never tell anybody outside the family what you're

thinking again!

(then)

Go on...

(then, after Sonny exits)

Tom...

(then, after a huge flower arrangement appears at the office entrance)

What -- what is this nonsense? 

TOM

It's from ah Johnny, starring in that new ah film. 

VITO CORLEONE

Ah -- Well, take it away. 

TOM (to person holding flowers)

Take it over there 

VITO CORLEONE

And uh, tell Luca Brasi to come in.

There's more news about your old man. The word is out on the street that he's already dead 

SONNY

Watch your mouth -- what's the matter with you? 

CLEMENZA (after being pushed up against the wall)

Jesus Christ; take it easy -- take it easy 

SONNY

Where was Paulie? 

CLEMENZA

Paulie was out sick. He been calling sick all winter. 

SONNY

How many times has he been sick? 

CLEMENZA

Only maybe three, four times. I mean -- 

SONNY

3, 4 times? 

CLEMENZA

-- I asked Freddy if he wants me to get a different bodyguard and he said "no." 

SONNY

Listen, do me a favor, pick him up right now, I don't care how sick he is. If he's breathing, I

want you to bring him to my father's house. Now, you understand? Now.

CUT TO: An abandoned diner / Sollozzo with kidnapped Tom Hagen -night 

SOLLOZZO (drinking coffee, to Tom)

Your boss is dead. I know you're not in the muscle-end of the family, Tom, so I don't want

you to be scared. I want you to help the Corleone's, and I want you to help me.

(then, handing Tom a drink)

Yeah, we got him outside his office just about an hour after we picked you up.

(then)

Drink it.

(then)

So now it's up to you to make the peace between me and Sonny.

(then)

Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he? And you knew it was the right thing to do. 

TOM

Sonny'll come after you with everything he's got. 

SOLLOZZO

That'll be his first reaction, sure. That's why you gotta talk some sense into him. The

Tattaglia family is behind me with all their people. The other New York Families will go

along with anything that will prevent a full-scale war. Let's face it, Tom, and all due respect,

the Don, rest in peace, was -- slippin'. Ten years ago could I have gotten to him?

(then)

Well -- now he's dead. He's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back. So you gotta talk to

Sonny, you gotta talk to the caporegimes, that Tessio and that Fat Clemenza.

(then)

It's good business, Tom. 

TOM

I'll try, but even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi. 

SOLLOZZO

Yeah, well, let me worry about Luca.

(then)

You just talk to Sonny -- and the other two kids. 

TOM

I'll to my best. 

SOLLOZZO

Good. Now, you can go.

(then, while walking out)

I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a business man. Blood is a big expense. 

[Outside, a car, sounding its horn, pulls up; Sollozzo goes to talk to them, and

returns] 

SOLLOZZO

He's still alive. They hit'em with five shots, and he's still alive! Well that's bad luck for me,

and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal! 

CUT TO: Michael arrives at Corleone compound. A car drops him off at the gate, and he

goes inside, seeing family and friends. The TRILOGY has some extra footage at the

SONNY (background, to Tom)

Whattaya think -- 

TOM (background, to Sonny)

Too much... 

SONNY (background, to Tom)

Huh? 

CLEMENZA (background, to Tessio)

...it's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia; Garbone,... 

TOM (background, to Sonny)

It's too far -- I think it's too personal... The Don'll consider this all... 

MICHAEL (to Clemenza)

You kill all those guys? 

SONNY

Hey, stay out of it, Mickey; do me a favor. 

TOM

Sollozzo's the key. You get rid of him, every falls into line. Now what about Luca? Sollozzo

didn't seem to be worried about Luca... 

SONNY

Aw --I don't know -- if Luca sold out we're in a lot of trouble, believe me. A lot of trouble. 

TOM

Has anyone been able to get in touch with Luca? 

CLEMENZA

Eh, I've been trying all night. He might be shacked up. 

SONNY

Hey, Mick, do me a favor -- 

TOM (background, to Clemenza)

Luca never sleeps over with a broad -- he always goes home when he's through... 

SONNY (to Michael)

-- try ringing him...

(then, to Tom)

Well, Tom -- you're consiglieri, now what do we do if the old man dies, God forbid. 

TOM

If we lose the old man -- 

TESSIO (background)

... Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, ... 

TOM

-- we lose our political contacts and half our strength. The other New York Families might

wind up supporting Sollozzo just to avoid a long -- destructive war. This is almost 1946 -- 

TESSIO (background)

... my people... 

TOM

-- nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies,

(then)

you make the deal, Sonny. 

SONNY

That's easy for you to say, Tom, he's not your father! 

TOM

I'm as much a son to him as you or Mike. 

[knock on door] 

SONNY

What is it? 

[Paulie enters] 

CLEMENZA

Hey, Paulie, I thought I told you to stay put. 

PAULIE

Well, the guy at the gates say -- say they got a package. 

SONNY

Yeah? Hey, Tessio, go see what it is. 

PAULIE (to Sonny, after Tessio exits)

You want me to hang around? 

SONNY

Yeah, hang around. You all right? 

PAULIE

Yeah, I'm fine 

SONNY

Yeah? -- 

[Paulie coughs, perhaps deliberately] 

SONNY

-- There's some food in the icebox, you hungry or anything? 

PAULIE

Nah, it's alright -- thanks... 

SONNY

How 'bout a drink? Have a little brandy -- that'll help sweat it out. Huh? Go'ahead, baby... 

PAULIE

Alright, sure -- that might be a good idea... 

SONNY

Yeah, right.

(then to Clemenza, after Paulie exits)

I want you to take care of that sonofabitch right away. Paulie sold out the old man, that

stronz'. I don't want to see him again. Make that first thing on your list, understand? 

CLEMENZA

Understood. 

SONNY

Hey, Mickey, tomorrow -- get a couple of guys, you go over to Luca's apartment; hang

around, waitin' for him to show up... 

TOM

Uh maybe we shouldn't get Mike uh mixed up in this too directly 

SONNY

Yeah, listen, uh... hang around the house on the phone an' be a big help, huh?

(then)

Try Luca again -- ga'head 

[Tessio enters with package, which he places on Sonny's lap] 

SONNY (unwrapping the package of Luca's bulletproof vest-wrapped fish]

What the hell is this? 

CLEMENZA

It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

I love you with all-a my heart! If I don't see you again soon, I'm a-gonna die! [laughs]

Heh, come over here, kid, learn something. You never know, you might have to cook for

twenty guys someday. You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some

garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; ya make sure it doesn't

stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs; heh?... And a

little bit o' wine. An' a little bit o' sugar, and that's my trick. 

SONNY (after entering the kitchen)

Why don't you cut out the crap. I got more important things for you to do.

I don't know... 

[Michael kisses Kay, then exits] 

CUT TO: Michael exiting the hotel

CUT TO: The hospital (10:30pm). Michael arrives by cab. He enters the quiet hospital to

find no one at the nurse's station. He walks down the hall to check an office, and only sees a

half-finished sandwich on a desk. He runs down the hall and up the stairs towards his

father's room. He pauses, noticing there is no guard outside the Don's door. He walks around

the corner up to Room #2 and hesitates before he pushing the door open. His father is in the

bed, and Michael wonders if he's alive. He walks up to the Don. -night 

NURSE (entering the room)

What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here now! 

MICHAEL

I'm Michael Corleone -- this is my father.

(then)

There's nobody here. What happened to the guards? 

NURSE

Your father just had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service. The police

made them leave about ten minutes ago. 

[As the nurse checks the Don's pulse, Michael picks up the phone] 

MICHAEL (into phone)

Ah, Get me, ah, Long Beach-4-5620, please...

(then, to nurse, who was leaving the room)

Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

(then, into phone)

Sonny -- Michael. I'm at the hospital. 

SONNY'S VOICE (over the phone)

Yeah? 

MICHAEL (into the phone)

Listen -- I got here late. There's nobody here. 

SONNY'S VOICE (over the phone)

What? Nobody? 

MICHAEL (into the phone)

Nobody... no no no Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone. 

SONNY'S VOICE (over the phone)

Don't panic -- I'll send somebody... 

MICHAEL (loudly)

I won't panic!

[hangs up the phone] 

NURSE

I'm sorry; but you will have to leave. 

MICHAEL (as he checks to see if the bed would fit through the doorway)

Uhh... You and I are gonna moo -- move my father to another room. Now can you

disconnect those tubes so we can move the bed out? 

NURSE

That's out of the question! 

MICHAEL

You know my father? Men are coming here to kill him. You understand? Now help me,

please. 

[Michael and the nurse roll the Don's bed to another room. We hear a door close,

then footsteps are heard coming up the stairs as Michael peers from the doorway. A man

holding flowers seems to be looking for a room] 

MICHAEL (coming out of hiding)

Who are you? 

ENZO

I am Enzo, the baker -- Do you remember me? 

MICHAEL

Enzo... 

ENZO

Yes, Enzo... 

MICHAEL

You better get out of here, Enzo; there's gonna be trouble... 

ENZO

If there is trouble, I stay here to help you. For your father -- for your father 

MICHAEL

Alright... Listen, wait for me outside in front of the hospital. Alright? I'll be out in a minute.

Go ahead... 

ENZO

Okay... okay. 

[Michael returns to the Don's room, at his bedside. The nurse is still in the room] 

MICHAEL

Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now. I'm with you now. I'm with you... 

[Michael kisses the Don's hand; the Don smiles, with a tear in his eye. Michael

leaves to meet Enzo outside of the hospital] 

MICHAEL (grabbing and tossing the flowers that Enzo is still holding)

Get rid of these

(then, as Michael turns Enzo's collar up)

Come 'ere... Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun. You'll be alright.

(then, after he sighs)

You'll be okay... 

[A black sedan pulls up to the front of the hospital. The occupants look at Michael

and Enzo, as Michael undoes a button of his coat and puts his hand in, as if he had a gun.

The car then drives off] 

MICHAEL

You did good. 

[Enzo, very scared, takes out a cigarette and has trouble lighting it with his Zippo

lighter. His hands are shaking. Michael takes the lighter and lights his cigarette, noticing

that his hands are not shaking. Sirens are heard as police cars screech to a halt in front of the

hospital. Michael shoos Enzo away as he is grabbed by an officer] 

OFFICER (grabbing Michael)

Now hold still... 

CAPTAIN McCLUSKEY (entering the scene)

I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up! What the hell are you doing here? 

MICHAEL

What happened to the men who were guarding my father, captain? 

McCLUSKEY

Why you little punk! What the hell are you doing telling me my business? I pulled them

guys off of here, eh! -- now you get outta here -- and stay away from this hospital! 

MICHAEL

I'm not moving until you put some guards around my father's room 

McCLUSKEY

Phil, take him in! 

OFFICER PHIL

The kid's clean, Captain. He's a war hero. He's never been busted for the rackets... 

McCLUSKEY (overlaps)

Goddamn it, I said take him in! 

MICHAEL

What's the Turk paying you to set up my father, Captain? 

McCLUSKEY

Take a hold of him. Stand him up. Stand'im up straight. 

[McCluskey punches Michael in the jaw as a Corleone car screeches up. Men get

out and run up the steps toward the Don's room. Tom and a couple of men go to get

Michael] 

TOM (to McCluskey)

I'm attorney for the Corleone family. These men are private detectives hired to protect Vito

Corleone. They're licensed to carry firearms. If you interfere, you'll have to appear before a

judge in the morning and show cause. 

McCLUSKEY (to his officers)

Alright... let'im go. [inaudible "Shit!" as he turns away] Come on! 

DISSOLVE TO: Corleone mall, during the day. Tom, Clemenza and Michael get out of the

car and walk through the gate, noticing armed men all over the mall. Tessio greets them.

-day 

CLEMENZA

What's with all the new faces? 

TESSIO

We'll need'em now. After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia 4

o'clock this morning. 

CLEMENZA

Jesus Christ...

(then, motions to Michael to come on)

It looks like a fortress around here... 

CUT TO: Inside the Corleone office -day 

SONNY (to Tom)

Tom-anuch! Hey, a hundred button men on the street twenty-four hours a day; that Turk

shows one hair on his ass, he's dead -- 

TOM (going to sit down)

Yeah? 

SONNY

-- believe me...

(then, to Michael, whose face is bruised from McCluskey's punch)

Hey, Michael, come're, let me look at you. You look beautiful! Beautiful! Just gorgeous!

(then, to Tom)

Hey, listen to this -- the Turk wants to talk. Eh gosh -- imagine the nerve of the sonofabitch,

eh? Craps out last night, and wants a meetin' today... 

TOM

What did he say? 

SONNY

What did he say -- Badda-beep, badda-bap, badda-boop, badda-beep -- He wants us to send

Michael here to proposition. And the promise is, that the deal is so good, that we can't

refuse. Eh... 

TOM (as Tessio enters the room)

What about Bruno Tattaglia? 

SONNY

That's part of the deal -- Bruno cancels out what they did to my father... 

TOM

Sonny, we ought to hear what they have to say... 

SONNY (standing in front of Tom, who's seated)

No; no; no! No more! Not this time, consiglieri. No more meetin's, no more discussions, no

more Sollozzo tricks. You give'em one message: I want Sollozzo -- if not, it's all-out war --

we go to the mattresses... 

TOM (stands)

Some of the other families won't sit still for all-out war! 

SONNY

Then they hand me Sollozzo! 

TOM

Your father wouldn't want to hear this! This is business, not personal, Sonny! 

SONNY

They shot my father -- that's business? Your ass... 

TOM

Even the shooting of your father was business, not personal, Sonny! 

SONNY (now seated behind the desk)

Well, then, business will have to suffer, alright? And listen -- do me a favor, Tom -- No

more advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win, please, alright? 

TOM (after they settle down)

I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw... 

SONNY

What about 'im? 

TOM

Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey has agreed to be

the Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo is being

guarded like this, he is invulnerable. Now nobody has ever gunned down a New York police

captain -- never. It would be disastrous. All the Five Families would come after you, Sonny.

The Corleone Family would be outcasts! Even the old man's political protection would run

for cover! So do me a favor -- take this into consideration. 

SONNY

Alright. We'll wait. 

MICHAEL

We can't wait. 

SONNY

Huh? 

MICHAEL (who's seated with his arms on the chair's arms)

We can't wait. I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal, he's gonna kill Pop, that's it.

That's the key for him. Gotta get Sollozzo. 

CLEMENZA

Mike is right... 

SONNY

Lemme ask you something, Professor, I mean -- what about McCluskey? Huh? What do we

do with this -- cop here? 

MICHAEL

They wanna have a meeting with me, right? It will be me -- McCluskey -- and Sollozzo.

Let's set the meeting. Get our informers to find out where it's gonna be held. Now, we insist

it's a public place -- a bar, a restaurant -- some place where there's people so I feel safe.

They're gonna search me when I first meet them, right, so I can't have a weapon on me then.

But if Clemenza can figure a way -- to have a weapon planted there for me -- then I'll kill

'em both. 

[Clemenza, Tessio and Sonny laugh. Tom shrugs] 

SONNY

Hey, whataya gonna do, nice college boy, eh? Didn't want to get mixed up in the Family

business, huh? Now you wanna gun down a police captain, why, because he slapped ya in

the face a little bit? Hah? What do you think this is the Army, where you shoot'em a mile

away? You've gotta get up close like this and bada-bing! you blow their brains all over your

nice Ivy League suit. Come're... 

MICHAEL (as Sonny kisses his head)

Sonny... 

SONNY

You're taking this very personal. Tom, this is business and this man is taking it very very

personal. 

MICHAEL

Where does it say that you can't kill a cop? 

HAGEN

Come on, Mikey... 

MICHAEL

Tom, wait a minute. I'm talking about a cop -- that's mixed up in drugs. I'm talking about ah

- ah - a dishonest cop -- a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was

coming to him. That's a terrific story. And we have newspaper people on the payroll, don't

we, Tom?

[Hagen nods in the affirmative]

And they might like a story like that. 

HAGEN

They might, they just might... 

MICHAEL (to Sonny)

It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business. 

CUT TO: Clemenza's Cellar. Clemenza is showing Michael the gun he's to use -day 

CLEMENZA

It's as cold as they come -- impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints, Mike. I put a

special tape on the trigger, and the butt. Here, try it...

(then, after Michael tries it but doesn't shoot it)

What's the matter, the trigger too tight? 

MICHAEL (after shooting the gun)

Maron, my ears... 

CLEMENZA (laughs)

Yeah, I left it noisy -- that way it scares any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.

(then)

All right, you shot'em both -- now what do you do? 

MICHAEL

Sit down, finish my dinner... 

CLEMENZA

Come on, kid, don't fool around. Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip

out. Everybody'll still think you got it. They're gonna be staring at your face, Mike -- so walk

outta the place real fast -- but you don't run. Don't look nobody directly in the eye -- but you

don't look away, either. Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff of you, believe me, so don't worry

about nothin'. You know, you're going to turn out all right. You take a long vacation --

nobody knows where -- and we're gonna catch the hell. 

MICHAEL

How bad do you think it's gonna be? 

CLEMENZA

Pretty goddamn bad. Probably all the other Families will line up against us. That's alright --

this thing's gotta happen every five years or so -- ten years -- helps to get rid of the bad

blood. Been ten years since the last one. You know you got to stop them at the beginning,

like they should have stopped Hitler at Munich, They should never've let him get away with

that. They were just asking for big trouble. You know, Mike, we was all proud of you --

being a hero and all. Your father, too. 

[Clemenza hands Michael the gun after adjusting it. Michael points and fires the

unloaded gun] 

CUT TO: The Corleone Dining Room (6:30pm). Sonny, Clemenza, Tessio and Rocco are

sitting around, eating Chinese food while waiting for news about where the Sollozzo

meeting will take place. Michael smokes as the others eat. -early evening 

TOM (as he enters)

Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing -- even Sollozzo's people don't know where the

meeting's going to be held. 

MICHAEL

How much time do we have? 

SONNY (checking his watch)

They're gonna pick you up in front of Jack Dempsey's joint in an hour and a half. Exactly an

hour and a half. 

CLEMENZA

We could put a tail on them and see how it turns out... 

SONNY

Sollozzo'd lose our ass going around the block! 

TOM

What about the negotiator? 

CLEMENZA

He's over at my place playin' pinochle with a couple of my men. He's happy, they're lettin'

him win... 

TOM

There's too much of a risk for Mike -- maybe we outta call it off, Sonny. 

CLEMENZA

The negotiator keeps on playing cards until Mike comes back safe and sound. 

SONNY

So why don't he just blast whoever's in the goddamn car? 

CLEMENZA

Too dangerous -- they'd be lookin' for that. 

TOM

Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny! 

[the phone rings, Sonny gets up to get it] 

SONNY

I'll get it.

(then, into the phone)

Yeah -- Yeah -- Well, thanks...

(then, after hanging up the phone and returning to the table)

Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx. 

TOM

Well is it reliable? 

SONNY

That's my man in McCluskey's precinct. A police captain's gotta be on call twenty-four hours

a day. He signed out at that number between eight and ten. Anybody know this joint? 

TESSIO

Yeah, sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his

business. It's perfect. Pete: they got an old-fashion' toilet -- you know, the box, and - and -

and - ah the chain-thing. We might be able to tape the gun behind it. 

CLEMENZA

All right. Mike: you go to the restaurant, you eat, you talk for a while, you relax. You make

them relax. Then you get up and you go take a leak. No -- better still -- you ask for

permission to go. Then when you come back, you come out blastin', and don't take any

chances -- two shots in the head apiece. 

SONNY

Hey, listen, I want somebody good -- and I mean very good -- to plant that gun. I don't want

my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? 

CLEMENZA

The gun'll be there... 

SONNY

All right

(then, to Tessio)

Listen, you drive him and you pick him up after the job, okay? 

CLEMENZA

Come on, let's move... 

[as they're leaving] 

MICHAEL'S VOICE (OS)

Thank you, Tom... 

SONNY (to Michael)

Did he - ah - tell you to drop the gun right away? 

MICHAEL

Yeah, a million times. 

CLEMENZA

You don't forget: two shots apiece in the head soon as you come out the door, ah? Let's go... 

MICHAEL (to Sonny)

How long do you think it'll be before I can come back? 

SONNY

At least a year, Mike. Listen - um - I'll square it with Mom, uh - you know, your not seeing

her before you leave; and uh, I'll get a message to that girlfriend, when I think the time is

right.

(then, after he and Michael embrace)

Take care, huh? 

TOM

Take care, Mike... 

MICHAEL (embracing Tom)

Tom. 

DISSOLVE TO: Jack Dempsey's Restaurant (8:00pm). Michael's waiting on the sidewalk

until Sollozzo's car pulls up and he gets in. -evening 

SOLLOZZO

I'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten everything out. I mean, this is terrible --

it's not the way I wanted things to go at all. It should've never happened. 

MICHAEL

We'll straighten everything out tonight. I don't want my father bothered any more... 

SOLLOZZO

He won't be, Mike; I swear on my children he won't be. But you gotta keep an open mind

when we talk. I mean, I hope you're not a hothead like your brother Sonny. You -- can't talk

business with him... [something in Italian] 

McCLUSKEY

Ahh, he's a good kid.

(then, as he leans forward, offering his handshake)

I'm sorry about the other night, Mike. I gotta frisk you, so turn around uh -- on your knees,

facing me.

(then, as McCluskey frisks Michael)

Ah, I guess I'm gettin' too old for my job. Too grouchy -- can't stand the aggravation. You

know how it is...

(then, to Sollozzo)

He's clean. 

[A little while later, as the car begins to cross the Triborough bridge. Michael

notices the sign that says "To New Jersey"] 

MICHAEL

We're goin' to Jersey? 

SOLLOZZO

Maybe... 

[Sollozzo's car does a high-speed U-turn, cutting off cars who sound their horns, as

Sollozzo's driver crosses over the road's divider into the other direction across the bridge] 

SOLLOZZO

Nice work, Lou. 

[Later, the car pulls up to Louis' Italian-American Restaurant. They enter] 

CUT TO: At a table in Louis' Italian Restaurant. The waiter brings a bottle of wine to the

table. -evening 

McCLUSKEY

How's the Italian food in this restaurant? 

SOLLOZZO

Good -- try the veal -- it's the best in the city. 

McCLUSKEY

I'll have it. 

SOLLOZZO (to the waiter)

Capide? [understand?]

(then, after the waiter nods, opens the bottle and pours the wine)

All right.

(then, to McCluskey)

I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike. 

McCLUSKEY

Go ahead... 

SOLLOZZO

Me dispiace... [I'm sorry...] 

MICHAEL

Lassa-i ["leave it alone/forget about it"] 

SOLLOZZO

[Sounds like, in Italian: "What happened to your father was business -- I have much respect

for your father -- but your father -- his thinking is old fashioned. You must understand why I

had to do that"...] 

MICHAEL

[Sounds like, in Italian: "I understand those things..."] 

SOLLOZZO (after the waiter brings McCluskey's veal, then exits)

[Sounds like, in Italian: "Now let's work through where we go from here... (more)"] 

MICHAEL

[Something in Italian]...come si diche...? ["How do you say...?"]

(then, in English)

What I want -- what's most important to me -- is that I have a guarantee: No more attempts

on my father's life. 

SOLLOZZO

What guarantees could I give you, Mike? I am the hunted one! I missed my chance. You

think too much of me, kid -- I'm not that clever. All I want, is a truce. 

MICHAEL (after a while)

I have to go to the bathroom. Is that all right? 

McCLUSKEY (while eating)

You gotta go, you gotta go...

(then, after Sollozzo begins to frisk Michael as he's standing)

I frisked him -- he's clean. 

SOLLOZZO

Don't take too long...

McCLUSKEY (while watching Michael enter the bathroom)

I've frisked a thousand young punks... 

CUT TO: Inside the restroom, Mike's looking for the gun behind the tank: He can't find it

CUT TO: Table. McCluskey glances toward the restroom; Sollozzo smokes

CUT TO: Restroom, when Michael finally finds the gun. He's relieved

CUT TO: Table. McCluskey glances up again

CUT TO: Restroom, where Michael hesitates by the door, preparing himself as a train is

loudly heard passing close by, just before he goes back to the dining area

CUT TO: Dining room: Sollozzo and McCluskey watch Michael emerge from the restroom,

hesitate at the door, then sit down 

SOLLOZZO (voice fading into background)

[Sounds like, in Italian:

"Everything all right? I respect myself -- understand? -- and cannot allow another

man to hold me back. What happened was unavoidable. I had the unspoken support of the

other Family Dons. If your father were in better health, without his eldest son running

things, no disrespect intended, we wouldn't have this nonsense. We will stop fighting until

your father is well and can resume bargaining. No vengeance will be taken. We will have

peace, but your family should interfere no longer...." (rough translation by Jim Coyle)] 

[Michael doesn't pay attention to Sollozzo -- he's under too much mental anguish.

He rises, and quickly shoots Sollozzo in the head. He then shoots McCluskey in the throat,

then the forehead as McCluskey holds his throat. McCluskey falls, overturning the table.

Michael goes to exit, dropping the gun. Outside, Michael gets picked up by Tessio, and they

speed off]

SONNY'S TWIN DAUGHTER

SONNY

All right

Here you are, big guy -- give it to Grandpa 

FRANK

Okay

(then, reading from his handmade card)

I hope you get well, Grandpa, and I wish I would see you soon. Love, your grandson, Frank. 

[Frank kisses the Don] 

MAMA

Ooohh... [then something in Italian]

Clemenza, Tessio, Tom, Fredo and Sonny are standing around the bed. -day 

TOM (sighs)

Since McCluskey's killing, the police have been cracking down on most of our operations --

and also the other Families. There's been a lot of bad blood. 

SONNY

They hit us so -- we hit 'em back. 

TOM

Through our contacts in the newspapers, we've been able to put out a lot of material about

McCluskey being linked with Sollozzo in the drug rackets. See -- things are starting to

loosen up. 

SONNY

And I'm ah sending Fredo to uh Las Vegas, under the protection of uh Don Francesco of L.A

-- I want him to rest. 

FREDO

I'm going to learn -- the -- casino business... 

SONNY

Yeah... 

VITO CORLEONE (whispering)

Where's Michael?

(then, a little louder, after Tom doesn't answer)

Where's Michael? 

TOM (after looking off toward Sonny, bends his head toward the Don)

It was Michael -- who killed Sollozzo. But he's safe -- and we're starting to work to bring

him back now. 

[The Don, markedly upset and angry, gestures that they leave him alone. They exit:

Tom, Tessio, Sonny, then Fredo] 

CUT TO: Hallway and stairs as Sonny and Tom descend -day 

SONNY

I want you to find out where that ol' pimp Tattaglia is hiding -- I want his ass now -- right

now! 

TOM (after he stops Sonny)

Hey -- Sonny... 

SONNY

What? 

TOM

Things are starting to loosen up a little bit. If you go after Tattaglia all hell's gonna break -- 

SONNY (background)

Oh, Tom... 

TOM (continuing)

-- loose. Let -- let the smoke clear -- Pop can negotiate. 

SONNY

No, Pop can't do nothin' til he's better! I'm going to decide what's going to be done -- 

TOM

All right, but your war is costing us a lot of money; nothing's coming in! -- 

SONNY (background)

Whattsa matter? 

TOM (continuing)

-- We can't do business. 

SONNY

Well neither can they! Don't worry about it. 

TOM

They don't have our over-head! 

SONNY

Please, don't worry about it! 

TOM

We can't afford a stalemate! 

SONNY

Well, then, there ain't no more stalemate -- I'm gonna end it by killin' that old bastard! I'm

gonna...kill... 

TOM

Yeah, well you're getting a great reputation! -- I hope you're enjoying it... 

SONNY

Well you just do what I tell you to do! Goddamn it! If I had a wartime consiglieri -- a

Sicilian -- I wouldn't be in this shape! Pop had Genco -- look what I got.

(then, after exhaling)

I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. Ma made a little dinner -- it's Sunday... 

TOM (walking away)

It's alright... 

CUT TO: Dining room, the family is eating at the table -evening 

SONNY (to Tom)

You know niggers are havin' a good time with uh -- our policy banks up there in Harlem --

SONNY (background, to Carlo)

Yeah... 

CONNIE

Well Papa never talked business at the table, and in front of the kids. 

CARLO

Hey shut up, Connie, when Sonny's talking... 

SONNY

Hey, don't you ever tell her to shut up -- you got that? 

CONNIE

okay... 

MAMA (to Sonny)

Santino ... don't interfere. 

CARLO

Hey look, Sonny, Tom -- I'd like to talk to you maybe after dinner. I could be doing a lot

more for the Family 

SONNY

We don't discuss business at the table. 

CUT TO: Fredo enters the Don's room and sites in the window seat

stops. Fabrizio opens the door for Tommasino -day 

Fabrizio

[In Italian: I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino] 

TOMMASINO

[In Italian: Michele, Why are you so far from the house? You know I'm responsible to your

father for your life] 

MICHAEL

[In Italian: I'm with Calo and Fabrizio...] 

TOMMASINO

[In Italian: It's still dangerous. We've heard from Santino in New York -- your enemies know

you're here] 

MICHAEL

[In Italian: Did Santino say -- when I can go back?] 

TOMMASINO

[In Italian: Not yet. It's out of the question] 

MICHAEL (as he starts to walk away)

Grazie.

CALO (sunbathing)

[In Italian: Stop bothering me with this rich America stuff!] 

Fabrizio (to Calo)

[Sounds like, in Italian: Eh, shut up...]

(then, to Michael, in English)

Eh, take me to the America -- if you need a good lupara in America, take me -- I'd be the

best man you can get.

something in Italian. -day 

Fabrizio

[In Italian: Mama mia what a beauty] 

Apollonia

[Something in Sicilian] 

Fabrizio (to Michael, who can't keep his eyes off of Apollonia)

Oh -- I think you got hit by the thunderbolt]

[Apollonia turns to look at Michael] 

DISSOLVE TO: A small village cafe. We hear "Sicilian Pastorale." The owner, Vitelli, after

MICHAEL

My name is Michael Corleone... 

Fabrizio (translates) 

MICHAEL

There are people who'd pay a lot of money for that information... 

Fabrizio (translates) 

MICHAEL (after Vitelli nods)

But then your daughter would lose a father... 

Fabrizio (translates) 

MICHAEL

...instead of gaining a husband.

SONNY (as he throws a sawed-off broom stick at Carlo)

Carlo, come'ere! -- come'ere!, come'ere!, come'ere!

(then, after catching him after a short chase and beating him)

You bastard! 

[Sonny punches and kicks Carlo while bodyguards hold back on-lookers. Carlo

screams when Sonny bites his knuckles which are clenched to a metal fence. Sonny slams a

garbage can lid on Carlo's head over and over. The one-sided fight continues until Carlo

ends up motionless on his back in the downpour of an open fire hydrant that kids were

playing in.] 

SONNY (exhausted)

You touch -- my sister again, I'll kill ya. 

[As Sonny begins to walk away, he stops, goes back, and kicks Carlo one last time]

what was that? 

TOM

Well that's an accident, but nobody was hurt... 

KAY

Tom --

(then, after taking a letter from her pocket and handing it to him)

will you give this -- letter to Michael, please? Please? 

TOM (refusing the letter)

Well, if I accepted that -- in a court of law they could prove that I have knowledge of his

whereabouts. Now you just be patient, Kay -- he'll get in touch with you, alright. 

KAY (as Tom touches her shoulder)

I let my cab go -- so can I come in to call another one, please?

CARLO

That's it, break it all you spoiled guinea brat -- break it all! 

CONNIE (running into the dining room as Carlo follows)

Why don't you bring...

Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner? And get... 

CARLO (after Connie tosses a pitcher of wine)

Maybe I will! Why not? Yeah you, ga'head... 

[Connie, screaming and crying, pushes vases and dishes from the cabinet onto the

floor, breaking them] 

CARLO (yelling)

Now clean it up! 

CONNIE (yelling)

Aw, like hell I will! 

CARLO (yelling, removing his belt and striking and chasing Connie)

Clean it up! Clean it up, you guinea spoiled brat! Clean it up! Clean it up, I said -- clean it

up! Clean that up! Clean it up! 

CONNIE (yelling)

You sonofabitch! 

CARLO (yelling)

Clean it up! Clean that up you sonofabitch! Clean it! Clean it up!

(then, once Connie picks up a butcher knife)

Yeah yeah -- come on now, kill me. Be a murderer like your father. Come on, all you

Corleones are murderers anyway. 

CONNIE (yelling, after Carlo grabs her arm, the knife falls, and she runs)

I will! I will! I hate you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 

CARLO (yelling)

Come on, you -- kill me. Get out here! Get out here! 

CONNIE (yelling, running into the bathroom, closing the door)

I hate you! 

CARLO (yelling, kicking the door open, and beating her as she screams)

Ga'head -- now I'll kill you! You guinea brat you! Get out here! 

CUT TO: The Don's kitchen. Mama Corleone answers the phone with a Santino Jr in her

arms, who's crying loudly. -day 

MAMA (into phone, as baby cries)

Connie, what's a' matter -- I can't hear you, what is it? Connie, talk louder -- the baby's

crying.

(then, as Sonny comes in)

Santino, I can't understand -- I don't know -- I don't understand 'er... 

SONNY (towards Sandra who's trying to calm the baby)

Shhhh

(then, into the phone just before the baby screams)

Yeah, Connie... 

CONNIE'S VOICE (on the phone, barely audible)

Carlo... -?- ...now don't you come... 

SONNY (into the phone)

Listen -- you wait there.

Come on -- 

TOM

Sonny! Sonny, come on...

Get out of here! 

TOM (to some buttonmen)

CUT TO: Causeway tollbooths. We faintly hear a baseball game over a radio. Sonny's car

drives up to the tollbooth. He grabs a bill from his pocket and hands it to the toll-collector.

The car in front of Sonny's seems to be having a problem moving and Sonny sounds his

horn. -day 

SONNY

Sonofabitch! Come on! Come on! 

[The toll-collector "drops" Sonny's change, and bends to pick it up, sliding the

booth's door shut. Sonny turns his head and notices a line of armed men pointing their

weapons at him. A fusillade of shots pelt the car, and Sonny, as he stumbles out screaming.

Once fallen and dead, a hitman comes up and shoots him from very close range, stops, then

kicks him in the head. The assassins flee before the Corleone car shows up] 

DISSOLVE TO: The Don's office at night where Tom Hagen is somberly having a drink. A

slow, somber version of the Title Theme is heard. The Don enters. -night 

VITO CORLEONE (holding out his hand for Tom's drink)

Give me a drop...

(then, after sipping the drink and handing it back to Tom)

My wife is crying upstairs. I hear cars coming to the house. Consiglieri of mine, I think you

should tell your Don what everyone seems to know... 

TOM

Ah, I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you just now and tell

you... 

VITO CORLEONE

But you needed a drink first. 

TOM (shaking his head, then says quietly)

Yup... 

VITO CORLEONE

Well, now you've had your drink. 

TOM (his voice breaking)

They shot Sonny on the Causeway. He's dead. 

VITO CORLEONE (exhales, bows his head; physically shaken and weakened)

I want -- all inquiries made. I want no acts of vengeance. I want you to arrange a meeting,

with the heads of the Five Families. This war stops now. 

[The Don, weakly standing, goes to embrace Tom. Then he begins to exit] 

VITO CORLEONE

Call Bonasera -- we need him now. 

[The Don exits, as Tom dials the phone] 

CUT TO: Bonasera, frightened, waiting by an elevator at his funeral parlor -night 

TOM (OS, into phone)

This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for Vito Corleone, at his request. Now -- you owe your Don

a service. He has no doubt that you will repay it. Now -- he will be at your funeral parlor in

one hour. Be there to greet him. 

CUT TO: The basement of Bonasera's funeral parlor. From the elevator, two men carry a

Well, my friend -- are you ready to do me this service? 

BONASERA (nervously)

Yes -- What do you want me to do? 

VITO CORLEONE

I want you to use all your powers -- and all your skills. I don't want his mother to see him

this way...

(then, after the Don uncovers the blanket, revealing Sonny's mangled face, shaken)

Look how they massacred my boy... 

CUT TO: Tommasino's Villa Courtyard, Sicily. Apollonia, laughing, is trying to drive the

car almost hitting the short walls. Michael is teaching her how to drive. The car stops, and

Michael gets out. All the while, they are laughing and joking in Italian. -day 

MICHAEL (once the car stops, he gets out)

[In Italian: It's safer to teach you English!] 

APOLLONIA

[In Italian: I know English...]

(then, in English)

Monday -- Tuesday -- Thursday -- Wednesday -- Friday -- Sunday -- Saturday... Andiamo!

MICHAEL

A salute, Don Tommasino 

TOMMASINO

MICHAEL

[In Italian: How are things in Palermo?] 

[Michael helps Tommasino out of the car as Apollonia runs over and kisses him] 

APOLLONIA

[Tommasino smiles at her, as she runs back to the car] 

MICHAEL

Come va Palermo? 

TOMMASINO

[In Italian: Young people don't respect anything anymore. Times are changing for the worse

-- Eh -- This place has become too dangerous for you -- I don't think you're safe here. I

want you to move to a villa near Siracusa, right now -- Subita, eh?] 

MICHAEL (putting his hand on Tommasino's chest)

[In Italian: What's wrong?]

Okay -- anything you say, Boss.

(then, after Michael exits)

Wait, I'll get the baggage...] 

CUT TO: Villa courtyard. Calo carries suitcases to the car and puts them into the trunk.

Apollonia is in the driver's seat. -day 

MICHAEL (seeing Fabrizio walking toward the gate)

Fabrizio! -- dove vai? [where are you going?]

[In Italian: Michele, wait there! I'll drive to you...]

NO! No, Apollonia! 

[The car that Apollonia is in blows up and Michael is thrown into the bushes] 

***EXTRA SCENE FROM THE EPIC, TRILOGY & SAGA: Michael, in shock, is lying in

Get me -- Get me -- Fabrizio

Find him... Fabrizio 

*** 

DISSOLVE TO: Bank building boardroom in New York City. There are Dons and aides

seated and standing around a conference table. Barzini sits at the head of the table. -day 

VITO CORLEONE

Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this -- meeting here today. And

also the other heads of the Five Families -- New York and New Jersey. Carmine Corleone

from the Bronx -- and ah -- Brooklyn -- Philip Tattaglia. An' from Staten Island, we have

with us Victor Strachi. And all the other associates that came as far as from California, and

Kansas City, and all the other territories of the country -- thank you.

(then, sitting down)

How did things ever get so far? I don't know. It was so -- unfortunate -- so unnecessary.

Tattaglia lost a son -- and I lost a son. We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees, then I'm willing

to -- let things go on the way they were before... 

BARZINI

We're all grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting. We all know him as a man of his

word -- a modest man -- he'll always listen to reason... 

TATTAGLIA

Yes, Don Barzini -- he's too modest. He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket. He

refused to share them... 

VITO CORLEONE

When -- when did I ever refuse an accommodation? All of you know me here -- when did I

ever refuse? -- except one time. And why? Because -- I believe this drug business -- is gonna

destroy us in the years to come. I mean, it's not like gambling or liquor -- even women --

which is something that most people want nowadays, and is ah forbidden to them by the

pezzonovante of the Church. Even the police departments that've helped us in the past with

gambling and other things are gonna refuse to help us when in comes to narcotics. And I

believed that -- then -- and I believe that now. 

BARZINI

Times have changed. It's not like the Old Days -- when we can do anything we want. A

refusal is not the act of a friend. If Don Corleone had all the judges, and the politicians in

New York, then he must share them, or let us others use them. He must let us draw the water

from the well. Certainly he can -- present a bill for such services; after all -- we are not

Communists. 

ZALUCHI (after some laughter from the group, stands)

I also don't believe in drugs. For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind

of business. -- 

[Tattaglia whispers something to his aide] 

ZALUCHI (continues)

-- Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders; if you put up three, four thousand

dollar investment -- we can make fifty thousand distributing." So they can't resist. I want to

control it as a business, to keep it respectable

(then, as he slams his hand on the table)

I don't want it near schools -- I don't want it sold to children! That's an infamia. In my city,

we would keep the traffic in the dark people -- the colored. They're animals anyway, so let

them lose their souls... 

VITO CORLEONE

I hoped that we would come here and reason together. And as a reasonable man I'm willing

to do whatever's necessary to -- find a peaceful solution to these problems... 

BARZINI

Then we are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled -- and Don

Corleone will give up protection in the East -- and there will be the peace. 

TATTAGLIA

But I must have strict assurance from Corleone -- as time goes by and his position becomes

stronger, will he attempt any individual vendetta? 

BARZINI

Look -- we are all reasonable men here; we don't have to give assurances as if we were

lawyers... 

VITO CORLEONE (holding up his hand to interrupt Barzini)

You talk about vengeance -- is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you? Or my boy to

me? I forgo the vengeance of my son -- But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son -- was

forced to leave this country, --

(then, as he stands, with Tom's assistance)

-- because of this Sollozzo business. All right -- and I have to make arrangements to bring

him back here safely -- cleared of all these false charges. But I'm a superstitious man -- and

if some unlucky accident should befall him -- if he should get shot in the head by a police

officer -- or if he -- should hang himself in his jail cell -- or if he's struck by a bolt of

lightning -- then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room. And that, I do not

forgive.

(then)

But -- that aside -- let me say that I swear -- on the souls of my grandchildren -- that I will

not be the one to break the peace that we have made here today... 

[The Don and Tom move toward the head of the table where Barzini is sitting.

Tattaglia does the same. The Don and Tattaglia embrace as the others applaud] 

CUT TO: The Don's car driving -night

CUT TO: Inside the car where the Don and Tom are sitting in the rear -night 

TOM

When I meet with the Tattaglia people, should I insist that all his drug middlemen have

clean records? 

VITO CORLEONE

Mention it -- don't insist. Barzini is a man who'll know that without being told. 

TOM

You mean Tattaglia... 

VITO CORLEONE

Tattaglia's a pimp -- he never'a could've outfought Santino. But I didn't know until this day that it was -- Barzini all along... 

***EXTRA SCENE FROM THE EPIC: Michael, who has returned from Sicily, is walking

and talking with the Don in the Don's garden. -day 

VITO CORLEONE

Look at this -- tomatoes, peppers -- all of this -- perfecto... 

MICHAEL

Pop, what about Sonny?

(then)

What about Sicily? 

VITO CORLEONE

I swore that I would never break the peace 

MICHAEL

But won't they take that as a sign of weakness? 

VITO CORLEONE

It is a sign of weakness... 

MICHAEL

Well -- you gave your word that you wouldn't break the peace, I didn't give mine. You don't

have to have any part -- I take all responsibility. 

VITO CORLEONE

Well, we have a lot of time to talk about it now 

*** 

CUT TO: New Hampshire School. Kay leads a group of children into schoolyard. -day 

KAY (to the children)

Come on, Nancy -- keep together, everyone. Blanche -- Okay, all right...

(then, when Kay notices Michael standing beside his Cadillac)

How long have you been back? 

MICHAEL

I've been back a year. Longer than that, I think.

(then)

It's good to see you, Kay... 

DISSOLVE TO: Country road. Michael and Kay are walking together as Michael's car

follows behind. A boy on his bike passes, followed by his dog. -day 

BOY (as he passes)

Come on, Dano! 

MICHAEL

I'm working for my father now, Kay. He's been sick -- very sick. 

KAY

But you're not like him, Michael. I thought you weren't going to become a man like your

father. That's what you told me... 

MICHAEL

My father's no different than any other powerful man --

(then, after Kay laughs)

-- Any man who's responsible for other people. Like a senator or a president. 

KAY

You know how naive you sound? 

MICHAEL

Why? 

KAY

Senators and presidents don't have men killed... 

MICHAEL

Oh -- who's being naïve, Kay?

(then)

Kay, my father's way of doing things is over -- it's finished. Even he knows that. I mean in

five years, the Corleone Family is going to be completely legitimate. Trust me. That's all I

can tell you about my business

(then)

Kay... 

KAY

Michael, why did you come here? Why? What do you want with me after all this time? Here

I was calling and writing... 

MICHAEL

I came here because I need you -- because I care for you -- 

KAY

Please stop it, Michael... 

MICHAEL

-- because -- I want you to marry me... 

KAY (shaking her head)

It's too late -- it's too late... 

MICHAEL

Please, Kay --I'll do anything you ask -- anything to make up -- for what's happened to us...

(then, after Kay shakes her head)

...because that's important Kay. Because what's important is that -- we have each other. That

we have a life together -- that we have children. Our children...

(then, after Kay puts her hands to her face)

Kay -- I need you. And I love you. 

[Michael beckons toward the car. Michael and Kay get in] 

DISSOLVE TO: The Don's office. The Don is feeding the fish in his aquarium. 

TESSIO'S VOICE (to Michael, OS)

Barzini's people chisel my territory, and we do nothing about it. Pretty soon there won't be

one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat! 

MICHAEL'S VOICE (OS)

Just be patient... 

TESSIO'S VOICE (OS)

I'm not asking you for help, Mike -- just take off the handcuffs. 

MICHAEL'S VOICE (OS)

Be patient. 

CLEMENZA'S VOICE (OS)

We got to protect ourselves -- Give me a chance to recruit some new men. 

MICHAEL'S VOICE (OS)

No -- I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting. 

TESSIO'S VOICE (OS)

Mike, you're wrong... 

CLEMENZA (to the Don)

Don Corleone -- you once said that the day would come when Tessio and me could form our

own Family. Til today, I would never think of it. I must ask your permission... 

VITO CORLEONE (looking away)

Well, Michael is now head of the Family, and if he gives his permission, then you have my

blessing... 

MICHAEL (seated on a chair)

After we make the move to Nevada -- you can break off from the Corleone Family and go

on your own. After we make the move to Nevada. 

CLEMENZA

How long with that be? 

MICHAEL

Six months. 

TESSIO (to Don Vito)

Forgive me, Godfather, but with you gone -- me and Pete'll come under Barzini's thumb

sooner or later... 

CLEMENZA

And I hate that goddamn Barzini! In six months' time there won't be nothing left to build

on... 

VITO CORLEONE

Do you have faith in my judgment? 

CLEMENZA

Yes... 

VITO CORLEONE

Do I have your loyalty? 

CLEMENZA

Yes -- always, Godfather... 

VITO CORLEONE

Then be a friend to Michael, and do as he says. 

MICHAEL (who is now seated behind the desk)

There are things being negotiated now that are gonna solve all your problems and answer all

your questions. That's all I can tell you now...

(then, to Carlo)

Carlo, you grew up in Nevada. When we make our move there, you're gonna be my right-

hand man.

(then, to the group)

Tom Hagen's no longer Consiglieri -- He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas. That's no

reflection on Tom, but that's the way I want it.

(then)

Besides -- if I ever need help, who's a better Consiglieri than my father? Well, that's it. 

[Rocco opens the door to let everyone leave. Clemenza walks past Michael, shakes

Don Vito's hand, and exits] 

TESSIO (shaking Michael's hand)

Alright... 

[Tessio walks past Don Vito as he exits. As Carlo exits, Vito pinches Carlo's

cheeks] 

CARLO

Thank you, Papa... 

VITO CORLEONE

I'm happy for you, Carlo. 

TOM (seated on the couch)

Mike, uh - why am I out? 

***EXTRA FOOTAGE FROM THE TRILOGY & SAGA*** 





*** 

MICHAEL

You're not a wartime Consiglieri, Tom. Things may get rough with the move we're trying. 

VITO CORLEONE (sitting next to Tom on the couch)

Tom -- I advise Michael. I never thought you were a bad Consiglieri. I thought -- Santino

was a bad Don, rest in peace. Michael has all my confidence, as - as you do. But uh -- there

are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen. 

TOM (to Michael)

Maybe I could help... 

MICHAEL (curtly)

You're out, Tom. 

***EXTRA FOOTAGE FROM THE TRILOGY & SAGA***

[In normal release and Epic: Don Vito pats Tom on the shoulder, gets up, and walks

over to Michael. He pats Michael on the chest, then his face] 

DISSOLVE TO: A montage of Las Vegas: The Desert Inn featuring Patti Page, El Rancho

Vegas featuring Joe E. Lewis & Gloria DeHave, and the Sands featuring Dean Martin &

Jerry Lewis. We hear Vegas-style music. -day

DISSOLVE TO: Las Vegas hotel. A limo drives to the entrance, and Fredo and Michael get

out

DISSOLVE TO: Fredo, Michael, Hagen, Neri, Rocco and bellboys walk towards a hotel

room 

FREDO (to Michael)

I can't get over the way your face looks -- it really looks good. This doctor did some job.

Who talked you into it, Kay?

(then, to the bellboys carrying the luggage)

Hey hey hey hey hey, wait! Hey -- leave them out here -- we'll deal with them later...

(then, after the bellboys stop)

He's tired -- he wants to clean up. But right now, let me open the door, alright? 

[Fredo opens the door. From the room comes music as Fredo waltzes in. The band,

consisting of an accordion, a standup bass, and a piano, plays "For He's a Jolly Good

Fellow." There are four Vegas girls sitting around the table as the band then plays "Mona

Lisa." Michael is not pleased. Johnny Fontane is standing behind the table] 

JOHNNY

Hello, Mike -- Welcome to Las Vegas! 

FREDO

It's all for you, kid -- eh

(then, towards Johnny)

It's all his idea, right? Didn't you -- 

JOHNNY

Well, your brother Freddy... 

FREDO

Well it was -- hey, girls here... Hah -- I'll be right back... 

JOHNNY (to Fredo)

All right -- okay 

FREDO (to Johnny)

You keep 'em occupied...

(then, to Michael)

Anything you want, kid -- anything. Huh? 

MICHAEL (curtly)

Who are the girls? 

FREDO

That's for you to find out... 

MICHAEL

Get rid of them, Fredo. 

FREDO

Hey, Mike... uh... 

MICHAEL

Fredo, I'm here on business -- I leave tomorrow, now get rid of them. I'm tired.

(then, exiting the shot)

Get rid of the band, too. 

FREDO (to the girls)

Hey, just take off! Come on, take off! Let's go. Hey -- Angelo...

(then)

Hey, come on -- SCRAM! 

JOHNNY (to the blonde he kisses)

Come on, honey, let's go 

FREDO (to Johnny)

Come on... I don't know, Johnny -- I don't know what the hell's the matter with him.

(then, to a girl)

I'm sorry, babe, come on --

(then to the band)

I don't know, he's tired...he's... 

MICHAEL

What happened to Moe Greene? 

FREDO

He said he had some business. He said give him a call -- when the party started. 

MICHAEL

Well give him a call.

(then, to Johnny, as they shake hands)

Johnny, how are you? 

JOHNNY

Hello, Mike -- nice to see you again. 

MICHAEL

We're all proud of you... 

JOHNNY

Thanks, Mike. 

MICHAEL

Sit down, Johnny -- I want to talk to you.

(then)

The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny. 

JOHNNY

Well I uh, owe it all to him. 

MICHAEL

Well he knows how grateful you are. That's why -- he'd like to ask a favor of you... 

JOHNNY

Mike, what can I do? 

MICHAEL

The Corleone Family is thinking of giving up all its interests in the olive oil business --

settling out here.

(then, after Johnny hmmms)

Now Moe Greene will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel so it could be completely

owned by the Family

(then, gesturing towards Tom)

Tom -- 

FREDO

Hey, Mike, are you sure about that? Moe loves the business -- he never said nothin' to me

about selling... 

MICHAEL

Yeah -- well I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

(then, after Tom hands Michael a set of contracts)

See, Johnny -- see we figure that entertainment will be a big factor in drawing gamblers to

the casino. And, we hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year.

(then)

Perhaps uh -- convince some of your friends in the movies to do the same. We're counting

on you... 

JOHNNY

Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my Godfather -- you know that. 

MICHAEL (as he and Johnny shake hands)

Good -- 

MOE GREEN (as he enters the room)

Hey, Mike! Hello, fellas -- everybody's here -- Freddy -- Tom. Good to see you, Mike... 

MICHAEL (shaking Moe's hand)

How are you, Moe? 

MOE (to Mike, as Johnny exits)

All right -- you got everything you want? The chef cooked for you special -- the dancers will

kick your tongue out, and your credit is good.

(then, to one of Moe's employees)

Draw chips for everybody in the room so they can play on the house. 

MICHAEL (as Moe sits down)

My credit good enough to buy you out? 

MOE (laughs, and so does Fredo who massages Moe's back)

Buy me out? 

MICHAEL

The casino -- the hotel. Corleone Family wants to buy you out. 

MOE (angry)

The Corleone Family wants to buy me out? No -- I buy you out, you don't buy me out -- 

MICHAEL

Your casino loses money -- maybe we can do better... 

MOE

You think I'm skimmin' off the top, Mike? 

MICHAEL

You're unlucky 

MOE (standing, angrily laughs)

You goddamn guineas really make me laugh -- I do you a favor and take Freddie in when

you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out! 

MICHAEL

Wait a minute -- you took Freddie in because the Corleone Family bankrolled your casino --

because the Molinari Family on the Coast guaranteed his safety. Now -- we're talking

business -- let's talk business... 

MOE

Yeah -- let's talk business, Mike. First of all, you're all done. The Corleone Family don't even

have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather's sick, right? You're getting chased out of

New York by Barzini and the other Families -- What do you think is going on here? You

think you can come to my hotel and take over? -- I talked to Barzini -- I can make a deal

with him, and still keep my hotel! 

MICHAEL

Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? 

FREDO

Aw now that -- that was nothin', Mike. Now -- Now uh Moe didn't mean nothin' by that. Sure

he flies off the handle once in a while, but Moe and me -- we're good friends, right Moe?

Huh? 

MOE

I gotta business to run. I gotta kick asses sometimes to make it run right. We had a little

argument, Freddy and I, so I had to straighten him out... 

MICHAEL

You straightened my brother out? 

MOE

He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time! Players couldn't get a drink at the table!

What's wrong with you? 

MICHAEL (collecting his things from the table before he stands)

I leave for New York tomorrow -- think about a price 

MOE (angry)

Sonofabitch -- Do you know who I am? I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were

going out with cheerleaders! 

FREDO

Wait a minute, Moe -- Moe, I got an idea --

(then, to Tom)

Tom -- Tom, you're the Consiglieri and you can talk to the Don -- you can explain... 

TOM

Just a minute now -- the Don is semi-retired and Mike is in charge of the Family business

now. If you have anything to say, say it to Michael. 

FREDO (after Moe storms out)

Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that! 

MICHAEL

Fredo -- you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone

against the Family again. Ever. 

{This is where The TRILOGY Tape #2 ends} 

CUT TO: Corleone mall. Michael's limo drives through the gate with him, Kay, and

Anthony. Anthony is sitting on Michael's lap. -day 

MICHAEL

I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me... 

KAY

Oh, Michael... 

MICHAEL

This weekend we'll go out

(then, after Kay hmmmms)

We'll go to the city -- we'll see a show and we'll have dinner. I promise. 

KAY (after she and Michael kiss)

Okay...

(then)

Oh, Michael -- Michael, your sister wants to ask you something... 

MICHAEL

Well let her ask... 

KAY

No -- she's afraid to. Connie and Carlo want you to be Godfather to their little boy. 

MICHAEL

Oh, well we'll see... 

KAY

Will you? 

MICHAEL

Lemme think about it -- we'll see. Come on -- 

DISSOLVE TO: The Don's garden. The Don, older looking now, sits with Michael -day 

VITO CORLEONE

So -- Barzini will move against you first. He'll set up a meeting with someone that you

absolutely trust -- guaranteeing your safety. And at that meeting, you'll be assassinated.

(then, as the Don drinks from a glass of wine as Michael watches him)

I like to drink wine more than I used to -- anyway, I'm drinking more... 

MICHAEL

It's good for you, Pop. 

VITO CORLEONE (after a long pause)

I don't know -- your wife and children -- are you happy with them? 

MICHAEL

Very happy... 

VITO CORLEONE

That's good.

(then)

I hope you don't mind the way I -- I keep going over this Barzini business... 

MICHAEL

No, not at all... 

VITO CORLEONE

It's an old habit. I spent my life trying not to be careless -- women and children can be

careless, but not men.

(then)

How's your boy? 

MICHAEL

He's good -- 

VITO CORLEONE

You know he looks more like you every day. 

MICHAEL (smiling)

He's smarter than I am. Three years old, he can read the funny papers 

VITO CORLEONE (laughs)

Read the funny papers --

(then)

Oh -- well -- eh, I want you to arrange to have a telephone man check all the calls that go in

and out of here -- because... 

MICHAEL

I did it already, Pop. 

VITO CORLEONE

-- ya'know, cuz it could be anyone... 

MICHAEL

Pop, I took care of that. 

VITO CORLEONE

Oh, that's right -- I forgot. 

MICHAEL (reaching over, touching his father)

What's the matter? What's bothering you?

(then, after the Don doesn't answer)

I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, I'll handle it. 

VITO CORLEONE (as he stands)

I knew that Santino was going to have to go through all this. And Fredo -- well --

(then, after he sits besides Michael)

-- Fredo was -- well -- But I never -- I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life, I

don't apologize, to take care of my family. And I refused -- to be a fool -- dancing on the

string, held by all those -- bigshots. I don't apologize -- that's my life -- but I thought that --

that when it was your time -- that -- that you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator -

Corleone. Governor - Corleone, or something... 

MICHAEL

Another pezzonovante... 

VITO CORLEONE

Well -- this wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time... 

MICHAEL

We'll get there, Pop -- we'll get there... 

VITO CORLEONE

Uh...

(then, after kissing Michael on the cheek)

Now listen -- whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting -- he's the traitor. Don't forget

that. 

DISSOLVE TO: The Don's tomato garden. The Don is with Michael's son, Anthony. -day 

ANTHONY

Can I hold it, please?

(then, taking the spray can from the Don)

Yeah, I will take care... 

VITO CORLEONE

Come're -- come're -- come're 

[The Don shows Anthony how to use the spray can] 

ANTHONY

Can I water these? 

VITO CORLEONE

Yeah -- over here -- over here. Be careful, you're spilling it -- you're spilling it...

(then, after Anthony sprays a tomato plant)

Anthony -- com'ere -- com'ere -- com'ere -- com'ere. There, that's right. We'll put it right

there. Aie -- watch this -- come here. I'll show you something, come here. Now you stand

there... 

[The Don cuts a piece of orange] 

ANTHONY

Give me orange... 

[The Don turns away and puts the piece of orange over his teeth. He turns toward

Anthony, grunting and holding his arms up like a monster. Anthony is startled, and starts to

cry. The Don rises, grabbing the boy] 

VITO CORLEONE (laughing)

Oh no?

(then, after picking up Anthony then setting him down again)

That's a new trick --

(then, pointing to the tomato garden)

You run in there -- run in there... 

[Anthony runs through the tomato garden, laughing, with the spray can. He and the

Don are chasing each other] 

ANTHONY (laughing)

See -- where are you?

(then)

Get down! 

[The Don takes the orange peel out of his mouth, laughs, then coughs. He starts to

fall, grabs for a plant, then falls to the ground. Anthony is still laughing and running around] 

ANTHONY

[Sounds like: I love you ... (more)]

(then, as he runs up to the Don with the spray can)

Uh - uh - uh - uh - uh - uh - uh - uh - uh - ouch! 

[Anthony, seeing the Don's lifeless body, runs to the house] 

DISSOLVE TO: Cemetery. We hear church bells as a procession of cars drives in.

Chauffeurs open car doors to let mourners out, including that old man who sang "Luna

Mezz'o Mare" at Connie's wedding reception. Michael, Tom, Mama, Connie and others are

sitting in chairs in front of the Don's flower-covered casket. They watch as mourners place

single red roses on top. We see Johnny, Clemenza, and his wife toss roses. Barzini tosses a

rose, and glances at Michael and nods. We see Tessio walking from Barzini, towards

Michael. -day 

TESSIO (into Michael's ear)

Mike, could I have a minute?

(then, after Michael and Tessio move away from the others)

Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. He says we can straighten any of our problems out... 

MICHAEL

You talked to him? 

TESSIO

Yeah -- I can arrange security. On my territory. Alright? 

MICHAEL

Alright... 

TESSIO

Alright. 

TOM (after Michael sits besides him again)

Do you know how they're gonna come at'cha? 

MICHAEL

They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground, where I'll be "safe" 

TOM

I always thought it would've been Clemenza, not Tessio... 

MICHAEL

It's a smart move -- Tessio was always smarter. But I'm gonna wait -- after the baptism. I've

decided to be Godfather to Connie's baby. And then I'll meet with Don Barzini -- and

Tattaglia -- all of the heads of the Five Families...

Hell, he can't do that -- it screws up all my arrangements! 

CICCI

Well, that's what he said. 

TOM (as another buttonman steps up)

I can't go either, Sal. 

TESSIO (as he sees a third buttonman step up)

Tell Mike it was only business. I always liked him. 

TOM

He understands that. 

CICCI (frisking Sal, taking his gun)

Excuse me, Sal... 

TESSIO

Huh?

(then)

Tom -- can you get me off the hook? For Ol' Times' sake? 


TOM

Can't do it, Sally. 

[Tom nods to buttonmen who take Sal to the car. Tom walks inside and pauses to

look out the window] 

CUT TO: Connie and Carlo's house. Tom, Michael, Neri and Rocco enter. Carlo hangs up

the phone that he was dialing. -day 

MICHAEL

You have to answer for Santino, Carlo. 

CARLO

Mike, you got it all wrong... 

MICHAEL

You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people. Ahhh that little farce you played with my sister -

- you think that could fool a Corleone? 

CARLO

Mike, I'm innocent -- I swear on the kids, Mike -- Please, Mike, don't do this to me. 

MICHAEL (as he pulls up his own chair)

Sit down. 

CARLO (sitting)

Mike, don't do this to me, please... 

MICHAEL

Barzini's dead. So is Phillip Tattaglia -- Moe Greene -- Strachi -- Cuneo -- Today I settle all

Family business, so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo. Admit what you did.

(then, to Neri)

Get him a drink.

(then, to Carlo, as Michael shifts in his chair)

Come on. Don't be afraid, Carlo -- Come on, you think I'd make my sister a widow? I'm

Godfather to your son, Carlo --

(then, after Neri hands Carlo a glass of wine)

Go ahead, drink it -- drink

(then, after Carlo drinks)

No -- Carlo -- you're out of the Family business, that's your punishment. You're finished. I'm

putting you on a plane to Vegas --

(then, to Tom, as he reaches out his hand)

Tom?

(then, after Tom hands Michael a plane ticket, which he hands to Carlo)

I want you to stay there. Understand?

(then, quietly, after Carlo nods and hmmms)

Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence -- and makes me very

angry...

(then)

Now who approached you? Tattaglia or Barzini? 

CARLO (after hesitating)

It was Barzini 

MICHAEL

Good.

(then, after standing)

There's a car waiting for you outside to take you to the airport. I'll call your wife, to tell her

what flight you're on. 

CARLO (as he rises, starts to protest)

Mike, please... 

MICHAEL

Come on -- get outta my sight. 

[Carlo turns. Rocco helps him put on his coat] 

CUT TO: Corleone gate. Buttonman is putting luggage into the rear of the car. Carlo gets

into the front seat. -day 

CUT TO: Interior of car. Clemenza is seen behind Carlo, in the back seat. -day 

CLEMENZA

Hello, Carlo... 

CUT TO: Carlo's house. Michael, Neri and Hagen emerge as Rocco locks the door. -day

CUT TO: Interior of car. Clemenza garrotes Carlo, who gets pulled back and kicks his feet

at the windshield, which breaks as the car takes off. Michael, Tom, and Rocco watch. After

the car pulls away, we hear the Title Theme music as they walk through the mall. -day 

DISSOLVE TO: The Corleone mall. Moving men load a truck labeled "John J. Bartek

Moving." We see a sign on the wall that says "Future Commercial Development - Genco

Land Co. - 5.6 Acres" with a small "sold" sign underneath it. A limousine drives through the

gate stopping besides the moving truck. Connie gets out, arguing with her mother who's

seated in the car. -day 

CONNIE (yelling from car)

Whattaya tryin' to tell me! 

MAMA (yelling from car)

Look -- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong! 

CONNIE (yelling, while getting out of the car)

Aw Mama, please!

(then, running into the house crying)

Michael! Michael! 

KAY

What is it? 

CONNIE

Where is he? -- Michael! 

[Connie and Kay run out. Connie opens the door to the Don's office. Michael's

sitting at his desk with Neri behind him. Kay follows] 

CONNIE

Michael! You lousy bastard -- you killed my husband! You waited until Papa died so nobody

could stop you, and then you killed him. You blamed him for Sonny -- you always did.

Everybody did. But you never thought about me -- you never gave a damn about me. Now

what am I going to do? 

KAY

Connie... 

CONNIE (to Kay, after Kay puts her arms around her)

Why do you think he kept Carlo at the mall? All the time he knew he was gonna kill'im.

(then, to Michael)

And you stood Godfather to our baby -- you lousy cold-hearted bastard. Want to know how

many men he had killed with Carlo? Read the papers -- read the papers!

(then, after she picks up and slams down a newspaper)

That's your husband! That's your husband! 

[Connie goes toward Michael. Neri holds her back until Michael motions it's okay] 

MICHAEL (taking Connie's arms as she cries)

Come on... 

CONNIE (struggling out of Michael's arms)

No! No! No! 

MICHAEL (to Neri)

Get her upstairs. Get her a doctor. 

[Neri takes Connie out of the room. Michael sighs, then lights a cigarette] 

MICHAEL (to Kay)

She's hysterical -- hysterical. 

KAY

Michael, is it true? 

MICHAEL

Don't ask me about my business, Kay... 

KAY

Is it true? 

MICHAEL

Don't ask me about my business... 

KAY

No. 

MICHAEL (as he slams his hand on the desk)

Enough!

(then)

Alright. This one time [Michael points his finger] -- this one time I'll let you ask me about

my affairs... 

KAY (whispering)

Is it true? -- Is it? 

MICHAEL (quietly, shaking his head)

No. 

KAY (after a sigh of relief and Michael kisses and hugs her)

I guess we both need a drink, huh? 

[Kay leaves the room to fix Michael a drink. At the same time, Rocco, Clemenza,

and Neri enter the office. Clemenza shakes Michael's hand. Kay turns her head to watch

them. They embrace Michael, then kiss his hand.] 

CLEMENZA (kissing Michael's hand)

Don Corleone... 

[Rocco kisses Michael's hand as Neri shuts the door blocking Kay's view] 



The screen blackens to indicate...
